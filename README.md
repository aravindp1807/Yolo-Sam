# 🎯 YOLO-SAM Segmentation Pipeline

> An interactive computer vision framework that combines YOLO object detection with Segment Anything Model (SAM) for high-precision instance segmentation on images and videos.

---

# 📖 Overview

The **YOLO-SAM Segmentation Pipeline** is a two-stage AI vision system designed to perform accurate object detection and segmentation with minimal user effort.

The pipeline leverages:

* **YOLO** for fast object localization
* **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** for pixel-level segmentation

By combining the strengths of both models, the system achieves highly accurate object masks while maintaining real-time performance.

The project includes a fully interactive **Google Colab GUI** built using `ipywidgets`, allowing users to upload custom models, process images and videos, visualize segmentation results, and download outputs without writing additional code.

# 🔬 Pipeline Workflow

## Step 1 — Object Detection

YOLO detects objects:

```python
results = yolo_model(image)
```

Output:

```text
Class ID
Bounding Box
Confidence Score
```

---

## Step 2 — Bounding Box Prompting

Detected boxes are passed to SAM.

```python
sam.predict(box=box)
```

---

## Step 3 — Segmentation

SAM generates masks:

```python
masks = predictor.predict()
```

Output:

```text
Binary Mask
Confidence Score
Segmentation Area
```

---

## Step 4 — Visualization

Masks are rendered over original media:

```python
overlay_masks(image, masks)
```

Result:

* Colored masks
* Detection labels
* Confidence values

---

# 📊 Example Output
